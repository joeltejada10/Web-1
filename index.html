        <h2>He/Him</h2>
        <p>I'm 22 years old. I attended AMCA in 2022, which was a great experience and influenced my decision to join Graphic Design. My only real experience with coding was when I took a computer programming class back in high school. Still, I hope to <strong>learn the most I can</strong> and <em><strong>keep improving myself.</strong></em></p>
